ðŸ“§ Building an Email Spam Detector with Machine Learning: Oasis Project ðŸ“§

Excited to be working on a new project with Oasisâ€”developing an email spam detector! Weâ€™ve all encountered spam emails filled with cryptic messages, scams, and phishing attempts, and this project uses Python and machine learning to build a model that can classify emails as either spam or non-spam.

Through this project, Iâ€™ll be exploring NLP techniques to process email content and then training a model to accurately detect spam. Itâ€™s a practical project that showcases the power of machine learning in enhancing email security and protecting users from potential threats.

Canâ€™t wait to share my progress and insights on creating an effective spam detection model!
